# Homework-1
Code that was Updated: I fixed the horiseon title to be a full word, I fixed the title to represent what the website is about, I added alt attributes to all of the images, 
I made the code use mostly semantic html to make it easier to read, I added smooth scrolling to the web links

This homework was fun to figure out, there was one link I couldnt get to scroll down but other than that I feel fairly confident on the work i did with the html.
